    - Steves Unknowns captivating audiences in their journey of great musical performances, and still savoring it in its purest sense is a band engraved in the annals of Bangalore’s music vault, deep in its tradition and history.
    - The band name by founder – Sridhar Stephen Joseph aka Steve – speaks for itself, as he goes down memory-lane recalling the birth of the name. “Once upon a time, backstage, preparing to come-on for the first time as a band, when the announcer interrupted me, demanding a band name. I paused for a moment, thinking deep – my mind was absolutely blank, regarding names–I was only thinking about the set list, not a band name in sight yet, it dawned on me the importance of this situation, we looked at each other, still no band name?We could not go unknown to the audience…the word Unknown for some strange reason echoed in my head, in-fact I’ve always believed I’m Unknown and from a deeper sense, I replied with ease, we are “The Unknowns”.
    - Since then, through glorious years of performing in and around India, as-well-as various parts of the world, until the band sang its final swan song, The Unknowns have jammed to the tune of many a versatile ear, be it fans of Rock N’Roll, Hard Rock, Heavy Metal, Blues, Fusion, Pop to those ardent Indian Raga fans–lashing out music in their trademark style, improvising western feel with strong Indian roots, leaving audiences moving and grooving to The Unknowns–who were not   just a band, but a band of brothers!
